## **thu 7 june**:
*	been busy with finding a new way to let the user use their own music since I found out that Soundcloud is not giving any API's anymore. The conclusion: I want to give the users a playlist and the possibility to upload mp3 files.

## **wed 13 june**: 
* 	created update-barchart function which takes the input of uploaded mp3 file.
*	created shape visualization 	
		*	circles added based on wavelength
		* 	I am considering making a shape-transition visualization because that might be cooler
*	I am having problems with putting both visualization in my html: it's hard to make 			functions out of the audio element which leaves me with 2 audio elements.. so I have to 	work on that!
