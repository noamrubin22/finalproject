# Music visualization 
Final project of the programming minor -
Noam Rubin 10800565 - June 2018

## Problem and solution
This visualization is perfect for music lovers that either don’t have the knowledge of how to use a DJ-set or don’t have the money to buy one. Often when a great idea of manipulating a song comes by it’s impossible for them to implement it. 
This data visualization will approach this problem by giving the users the freedom to add beats and change sounds. The shape visualization will be the finishing touch: after manipulating the song the visualization can be projected on parties!  

## Prerequisites
  * **Frequency barchart**: The Web Audio API with HTML5 gives access to control, modify and interpret audio within the browser. In this way the frequency can be stored in an array. Chart can be updated as frequency changes.

  * **Shape visualization**: using ‘requestAnimationFrame’ to update the array as the music changes.

  *	**Music manipulator**: this looks a bit more complicated. I am not sure how I will implement this but looking forward to get some advice from you.

## A sketch of the visualization


## Other implementations and difficulaties
Other implementations would be the ability to change the color-theme of the visualization or the shapes. I would expect difficulties by linking all 3 visualizations to each other. Besides, the option to add and manipulate sounds will be a challenge. 

## To do
